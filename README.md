✨ Key Features

Three Core AI Models: Specialized modules for body type analysis, diet planning, and real-time workout training.

User Authentication: Secure user registration and login system to manage your personal dashboard and track progress.

Interactive Dashboard: A central hub to view your stats, access AI models, and get workout recommendations.

Fully Responsive Design: A sleek, modern, and dark-themed UI that looks great on any device, from mobile phones to desktops.

🤖 AI Models & Technology

FitHub's intelligence is powered by a suite of specialized machine learning models running on a Python backend. Each model is designed to tackle a specific aspect of your fitness journey.

1. AI Body Type Analyzer

Purpose: To classify a user's physique into one of the three main somatotypes: Ectomorph, Mesomorph, or Endomorph.

How it Works: The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a large dataset of body images. It analyzes a user-submitted photo to identify key physical features and predicts the most likely body type, providing a confidence score for its classification.

Technology: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV for image preprocessing.

2. AI Diet Planner

Purpose: To generate personalized meal plans based on user-provided data.

How it Works: This model uses a combination of rule-based algorithms and machine learning to create a diet plan. It considers the user's body type, BMI, fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain), and dietary preferences to recommend meals that meet specific caloric and macronutrient targets.

Technology: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas for data manipulation.

3. AI Workout Trainer

Purpose: To provide real-time feedback on exercise form during a workout session.

How it Works: This feature utilizes a real-time pose estimation model. It processes the user's webcam feed to map out 33 key body landmarks (joints, limbs, etc.). By analyzing the angles and positions of these landmarks, it can determine if an exercise is being performed correctly and provide instant corrective feedback.

Technology: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe for pose estimation.

Prerequisites

Node.js
 (v18.x or later)

npm
 (usually comes with Node.js)

MongoDB
 installed and running locally.

Python
 (v3.8 or later) with relevant ML libraries.

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/donaldritch5865/FitHub-AI-Fitness.git
cd FitHub-AI-Fitness


Set up the Backend Server:

Navigate to the server directory:

cd server


Install the dependencies:

npm install


Create a .env file in the server directory and add your MongoDB connection string:

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fithub
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here


Start the backend server:

npm run dev


Your backend should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

Set up the Frontend Client:

Open a new terminal and navigate to the client directory:

cd client


Install the dependencies:

npm install


Start the frontend development server:

npm run dev


Your frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or another port if 3000 is busy).

You're all set! Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL to start using FitHub.
